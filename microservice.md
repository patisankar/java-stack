Overview
========
Microservice provide easy scallability of development, teams responsible for technology decision. Large team can work together in complex projects. MS will divide work small and work

Advantages
========
teams can act independently regarding domain logic and technology. This minimizes the coordination effort required for large projects.
Replacebility is easy. If we want to completely overriden, we can easily complately rewrittable. the dependencies between microservices have to be managed appropriately.
CI/CD, we continuesly bring new changes to production.
Free technology choice


Challenges
==========
Operational overhead
Increase latency overhead


Domain Driven Design, bounded context
=============

The legacy system can be gradually replaced by microservices. In the course of the migration, the focus should be on converting parts of the system into microservices that are currently undergoing major changes so that the migration to microservices is worthwhile. 
This is called the strangler pattern.
